Implemented spelling checker and auto correction of words using TRIE tree data structure using C language. Application will firstly find 
out the words which is not correct and give the options of another words realted to that word.

Trie Vs Hashing :
                A hash table (also called a hash map) is a data structure that is used to map keys to values in an unsorted way. 
    The hash value computation takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string t. Normally, the lookup process takes constant time if we have a good hash 
    function.
               A trie is a particular kind of search tree, where nodes are usually keyed by strings.In a trie, a link between two nodes represents a character in the 
    keyed string.
               Although the hash table has a relatively faster lookup speed, it only supports the exact match of the whole string. The trie solution is more flexible to support more applications, such as auto-complete. Also, we can easily print all the words in the dictionary in alphabetic order with a trie.
